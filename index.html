            <h2>Bangladesh</h2>
        <p> Bangladesh is located in the delta of the Padma (Ganges [Ganga]) and Jamuna (Brahmaputra) rivers in the northeastern part of South Asia. It is bordered by the Indian states of West Bengal to the west and north, Assam to the north, Meghalaya to the north and northeast, and Tripura and Mizoram to the east. To the southeast, it shares a boundary with Myanmar (Burma). The southern part of Bangladesh opens into the Bay of Bengal. In its southern region, Bangladesh is fringed by the Sunderbans, a huge expanse of marshy deltaic forest.</p>
